PyDev 5.4.0 Released

Release Highlights:
-------------------------------

* **Important** PyDev now requires Java 8 and Eclipse 4.6 (Neon) onwards.

    * PyDev 5.2.0 is the last release supporting Eclipse 4.5 (Mars).
    
* If you enjoy PyDev, please show your appreciation through its Patreon crowdfunding: https://www.patreon.com/fabioz.
    
* **Initial support for Python 3.6**

    * Code analysis for expressions on f-strings.
    * Syntax highlighting on f-strings.
    * Handling of underscores in numeric literals.
    * Parsing (but still not using) variable annotations.
    * Parsing asynchronous generators and comprehensions.
    
* **Launching**

    * Improved console description of the launch.
    * Support launching files with **python -m module.name** (instead of python module/name.py). **Note**: Has to be enabled at **Preferences > PyDev > Run**.
        
    
* **Debugger** 

    * Shows return values (may be disabled on preferences > PyDev > Debug).
    * When the user is waiting for some input, it'll no longer try to evaluate the entered contents.
    * Fix for multiprocess debugging when the debugger is started with a programmatic breakpoint (pydevd.settrace).

* **Unittest integration**
    
    * Bugfixes in the pytest integration related to unicode errors.
    * unittest subtests are now properly handled in the PyDev unittest runner.
    * The currently selected tests are persisted. 

* **Others**

    * In Linux, when applying a completion which would automatically add an import, if the user focuses the completion pop-up (with Tab) and applies the completion with Shift+Enter, a local import is properly made.
